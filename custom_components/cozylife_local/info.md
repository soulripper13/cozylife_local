## CozyLife Local Integration

This integration adds support for CozyLife smart devices to Home Assistant, using a **fully local** communication protocol.

**Features:**
*   **100% Local:** No cloud connection is required for device operation.
*   **IP Range Scanner:** Automatically discover devices on your local network during setup.
*   **Multi-gang Switch Support:** Correctly handles multi-button switches (like double rocker switches).
*   **Development Mode:** Allows for remote configuration for developers using the "Skip validation" option.

This integration was developed to provide a modern, reliable, and cloud-free alternative to older CozyLife integrations.
